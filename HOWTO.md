# Running the AI Scientist Assistant locally

CLI runners for each backend stage, plus the Flask API the frontend talks to.

> **Scope:** This product is limited to **bioscience** experiments — biomedical, life-sciences, microbiology, etc. Out-of-scope topics (climate, materials, pure chemistry) won't get useful output because the literature backend is biomedical-specific.

## Current backend (source of truth)

| Concern | Current implementation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Stage 1 lit search** | **Europe PMC** with multi-query rewrite | Free, no auth. ~40M biomedical papers. LLM emits 1-3 ranked queries (specific → broad); each runs against Europe PMC; results merged + de-duped by PMID/PMCID/DOI before the editorial pass picks 1-3 references. Each ref carries `key_differences[]` (per-reference structured deltas with citations). |
| **Stage 2 protocol source** | **protocols.io REST API (live)** via [`protocols_client.py`](protocols_client.py) | Multi-query fan-out + relevance filter; falls back to the cached samples in `pipeline_output_samples/protocols_io/` when offline. Researcher candidate-selection flow (`POST /protocol-candidates`) lets the user review + pick 1-3 sources with freeform notes before the architect runs. |
| **Stage 3 materials enrichment** | **Tavily + LLM** | `protocol_pipeline/materials_enrichment.py`. Every material row is enriched. Two tiers: `confidence: "verified"` (Tavily search + LLM extraction citing `source_url`) or `confidence: "estimate"` (LLM best-guess from training data when Tavily returns nothing usable). FE renders verified items with a `Source ↗` link, estimates with a `BEST-GUESS (LLM)` chip. |
| **Stage 4 budget** | **Derived on the FE** from enriched material prices | Real per-group USD subtotals on `/plan` summing parseable Tavily-cited prices. Header chip flips to "Partial cost (priced items only)" + "(N/M priced)" markers when coverage is incomplete. Non-USD prices excluded (no implicit currency conversion). |
| **Stages 5-7** | Pure-LLM (Gemini Flash) with deterministic compute where possible | `timeline.py` is fully deterministic, with strict + partial / lower-bound durations so 80%-covered phases surface `≥ N min` instead of "incomplete"; `validation.py` and `critique.py` use one LLM call each, every output cite-validated. |
| **AI chat over the plan** | `POST /chat` + `POST /chat/apply` | `chat_pipeline.py`. Single-turn tool-using completion. LLM proposes mutations as Apply / Reject cards (`update_protocol_step`, `add_material`, `update_material`, `remove_material`); applied changes persist to the plan + return updated `frontend_views` so the FE refreshes affected sections in place. |
| LLM (prototyping) | OpenRouter → `google/gemini-2.5-flash` | Day-to-day dev. Set `LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter` (default). |
| LLM (production) | Anthropic direct → `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Set `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic`. Uses prompt caching for the protocols.io context re-used across stages. |
| Caching | File cache under `.cache/` (per-source subdirs) | **24h** TTL for lit-review (multi-query rewrites need fresh ranking when the hypothesis iterates), 30-day for catalog gap-fill, 24h for pricing. Re-runs of identical queries are free. |

**Stage 1 has gone through three backends.** History (most recent first): Europe PMC (current) ← Semantic Scholar (rate-limited too aggressively without a key) ← Tavily (snippets didn't surface bibliographic metadata, forcing LLM extraction and hallucinated authors). The Europe PMC swap eliminated the entire fact-extraction layer.

## One-time setup

```bash
# from the repo root
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate         # Windows bash / Git Bash
# .venv\Scripts\activate              # Windows cmd / PowerShell
# source .venv/bin/activate           # macOS / Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure `.env` exists with your keys filled in (copy from `.env.example` if you haven't).

> Stage 1 does **not** require a Europe PMC key. If you set the optional `TAVILY_API_KEY` you also unlock the Stage 3/4 client (not yet wired into a runner).

## Run the CLI test harness

```bash
# Default: trehalose sample, full pipeline (Europe PMC + LLM)
python run_lr.py

# Different sample
python run_lr.py crp
python run_lr.py lactobacillus

# Tavily-only smoke test (legacy; not part of Stage 1 anymore — kept for Stage 3/4 pre-flight)
python run_lr.py --tavily-only
python run_lr.py crp --tavily-only

# Run all bioscience samples end-to-end
python run_lr.py --all

# Also dump raw smoke-test JSON (useful for tuning)
python run_lr.py --raw
```

## What it does

1. **Loads `.env`** and validates the LLM key for whichever provider `LLM_PROVIDER` is set to.
2. **Pre-flight smoke test** — fires a pre-baked Tavily query (legacy harness; doesn't reflect the real Stage 1 path anymore — it'll move to a Europe PMC smoke when we get to it).
3. **Full Stage 1 pipeline** (skipped if `--tavily-only`):
   - LLM rewrites the structured hypothesis into 1-3 ranked Europe PMC queries (specific → broad)
   - Each query → one Europe PMC call; results merged + de-duped by PMID/PMCID/DOI (cached for 24 hours per query)
   - LLM editorial pass: classifies novelty + selects 1–3 references with `description` / `importance` / `matched_on` / `relevance_score`
   - Post-process: HTML strip on titles, summary truncation to 4 sentences
   - Writes a `LitReviewSession` to `ExperimentPlan.lit_review`
   - Saves the plan JSON to `plans/plan_<id>.json`

## Costs per run (full pipeline)

- **Europe PMC:** free, no key, no per-call cost. Cached for 7 days.
- **LLM:** ~3 calls per sample (query rewrite + classification, occasional retry). On Gemini 2.5 Flash via OpenRouter, ~$0.001 per sample. Practically free.

## Output

A JSON file at `plans/plan_<id>.json` containing the full `ExperimentPlan` blackboard. Inspect with:

```bash
cat plans/plan_*.json | jq .lit_review
cat plans/plan_*.json | jq .status
```

Re-runs build a new plan each time. Old plan JSONs accumulate in `plans/` (gitignored).

For frontend integration, the most recent successful runs are also mirrored into [`pipeline_output_samples/`](pipeline_output_samples/) — those are the canonical fixtures for FE work.

## API server (for the frontend)

A Flask app exposes every shipped stage over HTTP. The React frontend (under `frontend/`) calls these directly through a Vite dev proxy.

```bash
# dev
python -m flask --app app run --port 5000
# or:
python app.py
# server on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Endpoints:

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | — | `{"ok": true, ...}` |
| `POST` | `/lit-review` | `{"structured": {...}, "domain": "..."}` (see below) | `LitReviewOutput` + `plan_id` |
| `POST` | `/protocol-candidates` | `{"plan_id": "..."}` or `{"structured": {...}}` | Ranked protocols.io candidates for researcher review |
| `POST` | `/protocol` | `{"plan_id": "..."}` or `{"structured": {...}, "candidate_ids": [...]}` | `frontend_view` + raw `ProtocolGenerationOutput` |
| `POST` | `/protocol/pdf` | `{"plan_id": "..."}` | PDF stream of the protocol |
| `POST` | `/materials` | `{"plan_id": "..."}` | `frontend_view` + raw `MaterialsOutput` |
| `POST` | `/timeline` | `{"plan_id": "..."}` | `TimelineOutput` (deterministic) |
| `POST` | `/validation` | `{"plan_id": "..."}` | `ValidationOutput` |
| `POST` | `/critique` | `{"plan_id": "..."}` | `DesignCritique` |
| `POST` | `/chat` | `{"plan_id": "...", "page": "/plan", "message": "...", "history": [...]}` | `{message, proposed_mutations[]}` |
| `POST` | `/chat/apply` | `{"plan_id": "...", "mutations": [...]}` | `{applied_ids[], errors[], frontend_views{...}}` |

Budget is computed on the FE from Tavily-enriched material prices (no `/budget` endpoint). Stage 8 (`/summary`) is not yet exposed.

Sample request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/lit-review \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "structured": {
      "research_question": "Does trehalose improve HeLa post-thaw viability vs DMSO?",
      "subject": "HeLa cells",
      "independent": "Cryoprotectant identity",
      "dependent": "Post-thaw viability",
      "conditions": "Slow freeze, LN2, rapid thaw, trypan blue",
      "expected": ">=15 percentage point increase"
    },
    "domain": "cell_biology"
  }'
```

Errors:
- `400 request_body_required` — body wasn't JSON
- `422 validation_error` — `structured` fields missing or malformed; `detail[]` has Pydantic field errors
- `500 pipeline_error` — LLM or Europe PMC failure

CORS is enabled for any origin so the FE dev server / Vercel preview can hit it directly.

To **containerize** Stage 1 as a standalone service, copy `src/`, `lit_review_pipeline/`, `inputs/`, `requirements.txt`, and `app.py`. That's the minimum runnable surface.

## Tests

```bash
# All unit tests (skip live integration; safe for CI)
pytest -m "not live"

# Including live integration tests (hits Europe PMC for real)
pytest

# Only the live integration suite
pytest -m live -v

# Verbose, show print output
pytest -v -s
```

Test layout:

| File | What it covers | Network? |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/test_europe_pmc.py` | EPMC client request shape, cache reuse, sample-set integrity, live API behavior | yes (live tests gated on `@live` marker) |
| `tests/test_tavily.py` | Stage 3/4 Tavily wrapper params, cache, error paths | yes (gated) |
| `tests/test_extractors.py` | Year/DOI/venue regex, author validation, `_clean_text`, `_truncate_to_n_sentences` | no |
| `tests/test_api.py` | Flask `/health` and `/lit-review` routing, validation errors, pipeline errors (Stage 1 runner monkey-patched) | no |

Cache is redirected to a temp dir for the test session — running tests does not pollute the real `.cache/`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `Missing env vars in .env` | Forgot to copy `.env.example` to `.env` or fill in a key |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set` despite `.env` having it | `.env` not at repo root, or running from wrong directory — must be run from repo root |
| LLM JSON parse error | Model returned non-JSON despite the prompt; the runner retries once. If still failing, set `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic` for stricter output. |
| Europe PMC 429 (rate limit) | Cache should prevent this; if you genuinely blow through, wait ~30s. Europe PMC has no published hard limit but throttles bursts. |
| Encoding error on stdout | Run with `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` (Windows console default is cp1252; `run_lr.py` and `app.py` already force UTF-8 for their own streams). |
