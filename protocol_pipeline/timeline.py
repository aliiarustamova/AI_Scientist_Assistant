"""Stage 5: Timeline computation.

Builds a deterministic, citeable Timeline from the protocol's per-step
durations. NO LLM CALL. Same protocol input -> byte-for-byte same
timeline output (modulo the timestamp on `generated_at`).

Design principles:
  - **Deterministic**: every value is computed from the protocol via
    explicit summation. Researchers can reproduce by hand.
  - **Defensible**: each phase carries `methodology` text and `coverage`
    (fraction of steps with duration data) so the user can audit every
    claim. Conservative-by-design: a phase with any missing duration
    returns `duration=None` rather than a misleading partial sum.
  - **Citeable**: each phase's id ("phase-{procedure_index}") and
    procedure_index back-link the user to the source procedure.

What this stage does NOT compute (documented in `assumptions`):
  - Hands-on time vs. wall-clock time (no ground truth on the FE side)
  - Parallelization opportunities (would need a dependency analysis the
    architect doesn't currently emit)
  - Calendar dates (no start_date input yet; `earliest_completion_date`
    stays None)
