"""Stage 2 + 3 orchestrator.

Reads:  hypothesis (and protocols.io static samples by name)
Writes: ExperimentPlan.protocol (ProtocolGenerationOutput)
        ExperimentPlan.materials (MaterialsOutput)

Flow:
  1. Load + normalize protocols.io samples (offline; from
     pipeline_output_samples/protocols_io/).
  2. Relevance filter (1 LLM call): drop sources below threshold.
  3. Architect (1 LLM call): emit ProtocolOutline with 3-8 procedures.
  4. Procedure writers (N parallel LLM calls): one per procedure.
  5. Materials roll-up (1 LLM call): consolidate equipment + reagents
     across procedures with concrete specs.
  6. Validate + bind to Pydantic types, write to blackboard.

Total LLM calls: 3 + N_procedures (typically 7-9 per run).

This stage runs against the static samples committed to the repo, NOT
against a live protocols.io fetch. The teammate's protocols.io client
is being built on a separate branch; the only swap needed when it
lands is the source loader (currently `sources.load_all_samples()`).

protocols.io's full-text search ANDs every token, so multi-word queries with rare combinations collapse to zero hits. We try your queries in order until one returns results, so RANK FROM MOST-LIKELY-TO-MATCH-MANY-PROTOCOLS to MOST-SPECIFIC.

Strategy:
- First query: ONE common single-concept word — the broad technique or reagent class (e.g., "trehalose", "ELISA", "Lactobacillus", "FITC-dextran").
- Second query: a different angle in case the first misses (e.g., the assay name, organism class, or alternative reagent).
- Third query (optional): one more concept word.

Each query is 1-3 words MAX. Single words preferred. Avoid acronyms specific to one paper (e.g., not "LGG", use "Lactobacillus").

CRITICAL: Do NOT output a line that is ONLY a rare chemical/assay abbreviation (2-4 ALL-CAPS letters like DCIP, BCA, TMB, AEBSF). These match random protocols. Prefer a technique or enzyme class: "enzyme assay", "dehydrogenase", "spectrophotometry", "colorimetric", "mitochondrial", or a spelled-out reagent. If the hypothesis centers on a small molecule, also suggest the common name ("succinate") not an obscure readout tag.

Examples:
- HeLa cryopreservation with trehalose vs DMSO →
    trehalose
    cryopreservation
    cell freezing
- CRP detection by paper biosensor →
    C-reactive protein
    ELISA
    biosensor
- Gut barrier in mice with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, FITC-dextran assay →
    Lactobacillus
    FITC-dextran
    intestinal permeability

Output ONLY the queries, ONE PER LINE, no numbering, no explanation, no quotes."""
